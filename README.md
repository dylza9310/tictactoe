5. Basic AI for Easy Level (2 days)
   - Implement a simple AI that makes random valid moves.

6. Intermediate AI for Medium Level (3 days)
   - Implement an AI that blocks player wins and makes winning moves if possible.

7. Advanced AI for Hard Level (4 days)
   - Implement the Minimax algorithm for unbeatable AI.

8. Difficulty Selection (2 days)
   - Add a menu for players to select the difficulty level.
   - Integrate the different AI levels into the game loop.

9. User Interface Enhancements (3 days)
    - Improve the console interface for better user experience.
    - Add color and formatting to the console output.

10. Testing and Debugging (4 days)
    - Test the game thoroughly to find and fix bugs.
    - Ensure all difficulty levels work as expected.

11. Documentation (2 days)
    - Write comments and docstrings for functions.
    - Create a README file with instructions on how to run the game.

12. Final Review and Deployment (2 days)
    - Review the code for any improvements or optimizations.
    - Deploy the game (e.g., share the GitHub repository or create an executable).


Tips to build the projects:
--------------------------------------------------

1. Data Structures:
   - Use a list of lists to represent the game board. This allows you to easily access and modify the state of the board during gameplay.

2. Functions:
   - Display Function: Create a function to iterate over the board data structure and print the current state of the board to the console. This function handles the visual representation of the game.
   - Input Handling Function: Implement a function to manage player input. This function should validate the input to ensure it is within the acceptable range and that the desired move is valid.
   - Update Function: Use a function to update the board data structure based on valid player moves. This function modifies the state of the game.

3. Control Flow:
   - Loops: Utilize loops to repeatedly display the board, prompt for player input, and update the game state. This creates the main game loop that continues until the game is over.
   - Conditional Statements: Employ conditional statements to check for win conditions, draw conditions, and to switch between players. These statements use Boolean expressions to evaluate the state of the game.

4. Boolean Functions:
   - Win Condition Function: Develop a Boolean function that checks the board for any winning combinations. This function returns `True` if a player has won and `False` otherwise.
   - Draw Condition Function: Create a Boolean function to determine if the game has ended in a draw. This function checks if there are any remaining valid moves and returns `True` if no moves are left and no player has won.

5. Player Switching:
   - Implement a function or a simple conditional statement to switch the current player. This ensures that players alternate turns.


6. Modularity:
   - Organize the code into functions that each handle a specific aspect of the game. This modular approach makes the code easier to read, maintain, and debug.

7. Main Function:
   - Use a main function to encapsulate the primary game loop and control the flow of the game. This function calls other functions to display the board, handle input, update the game state, and check for win or draw conditions.

8. User Interface:
   - Enhance the console output with formatting and, if possible, color to improve the user experience. This can involve using special characters or escape sequences to create a more visually appealing board representation.
